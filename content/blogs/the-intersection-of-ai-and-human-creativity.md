Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a tool â€” it's becoming a creative collaborator. From generative art to music composition, AI is reshaping how we define creativity.

## Can Machines Be Creative?

- AI assists in brainstorming
- It generates variations and ideas humans might overlook
- But it still lacks intuition and emotion
