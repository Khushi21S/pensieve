Next.js is powerful â€” but performance requires attention. Here are 5 quick tips:

1. Use `Image` from `next/image` for lazy-loaded responsive images.
2. Avoid unnecessary server-side rendering.
3. Use `getStaticProps` wherever possible.
4. Enable compression (gzip or Brotli).
5. Analyze bundle size with `next build && next export`.

Try these out and notice the improvement.
